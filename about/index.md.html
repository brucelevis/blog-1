        **About**

I'm Sepehr Taghdisian, wanna-be engine creator and indie game developer. I blog here about the stuff that I'm doing.

Mostly I'm working on my open-source stuff, trying to make my own multiplatform game development tools. Unfortunately in the place that I live, there is little to no incentive for gamedev studios to do low-level game development and almost every game company use unity or unreal exclusively, so my skills as engine developer mostly remain as hobbies and open-source contributions.

Here are my active projects on github:

- [rizz](https://github.com/septag/rizz): Lightweight and portable game development framework in C.
- [sx](https://github.com/septag/sx): Portable base library for C programmers, designed for performance and simplicity.
- [glslcc](https://github.com/septag/glslcc): GLSL cross-compiler using SPIRV-cross
- [dds-ktx](https://github.com/septag/dds-ktx): Single header KTX/DDS reader
- [sjson](https://github.com/septag/sjson): Fast and portable single-header C file Json encoder/decoder
- [atlasc](https://github.com/septag/atlasc): Builds atlas texture from a bunch of input images. 

Here are some of past projects. Some of them were commercially used but most of them were done for the purpose of learning game and engine development:

# Fisherboy <small>(2017-2018)</small>

Our studio's first mobile game, which is currently released in [domestic market](https://cafebazaar.ir/app/com.glitterbombgames.fisherboy/?l=en) as _"Amiroo"_. Unfortunately, the game haven't yet released on google and apple stores due to sanctions laws.

For this game, I have built our own C++ open-source engine and tools called [termite](https://github.com/septag/termite). For more detailed technical information you can check out my [blog post](../posts/fisherboy-technical).

# Darkhammer Engine <small>(2012-2014)</small>

My first attempt at learning multi-platform engine development. It was written in C99, had Lua, C# and python bindings. Ran on Linux/Windows and Mac.
The graphics features are roughly same as the previous version, But in terms of engine design and general programming, I have learned many stuff with this project, including rediscovering how better C language was compared to most C++ stuff, OpenGL and above all, multiplatform programming. 

You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/septag/darkhammer) and see some videos about the project tech. 
Some of the techs include:

- Direct3D11/OpenGL4 renderer
- Basic physically based lighting 
- Software occlusion culling using SSE4
- Hot loading of assets
- Embedded Profiler with Web based client
- PhysX integration
- Scripting support for Lua. C# and Python bindings
- Character animation controller 
- Strict memory management
- Cascaded shadow maps
- Tile based deferred rendering (CPU tiles)

# Hammer Engine v0.7 <small>(2007-2009)</small>

Upgraded rendering to a more robust pipeline, this version of _Hammer Engine_ included:

- Direct3D10 Renderer
- Faster Rendering, deferred lighting/light prepass
- tile based light culling
- HDR rendering with MSAA
- Shader Graph editor and builder
- Automatic exposure control
- Tools are based on Qt4 framework

# Hammer Engine v0.6 <small>(2006-2007)</small>

This is when I got my upgraded my desktop and got Direct3D9 graphics card. So I decided to rewrite the previous _hammer_ 
engine using a new renderer. I had a lot of fun with it because it introduced me to shaders and 
I learned many graphic techniques:

- Direct3D9 renderer
- Per-Pixel Motion blur using velocity buffers
- Per-Pixel lighting and shadows
- Cascaded shadow maps
- Deferred Rendering (Fat GBuffer)
- Normal maps
- Spot/Omni/Directional Lighting

# Hammer Engine v0.3 <small>(2004-2005)</small>

This is my first attempt at learning game engine development. Inspired by Quake3/Unreal engines. 
I decided to try and make my own:

- Direct3D8 renderer
- BSP + PVS compiler
- Lightmap support
- World/Asset editor based on MFC framework!
- Collision detection based on BSP tree
- Rendering based on BSP-tree
- Culling based on PVS
- Skinning and basic skeletal animation
- Dynamic object lighting based on ray-traced light visibility Octree
- Perpixel (non-shader) normal mapping.

# OptiCut <small>(2002-2003)</small>

I had this project as a contract job with _Iran Khodro co._ called _OptiCut_, which was used in their 
interior assembly line to minimize the excess fabric. It basically was a polygon fitting tool.  
It used different algorithms to achieve the effect, including Genetic Algorithms, Polygon pairing 
and heuristic box stacking, export/import DXF.
